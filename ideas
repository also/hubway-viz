What stations have the longest trips? Are they further from other stations?
Station density (for each spot on the map, compute how many stations within some distance.
What bikes have the most milage? What bikes sit around, especially at busy stations?
What data problems are there? Impossible trip speeds, double-used bikes, etc.
One way vs two way (trips where the reverse is less common)
Overall directional trends (vector field?)
Clustering (morning, evening, direction, duration)

bike movement not in trips

Bike data (and for stations where applicable):
distance traveled
first use
last use
used days (number of days it was actually in use)

Station data:
distance matrix
closest station
elevation
other station distance distribution (4 within .5 miles, 9 within 1 mile)
proximity to mass transit

Trip data:
next bike trip
all station pair data

Station pair data:
compass direction
elevation change
rise
fall
average incline
crow flies distance
probable on the ground distance
equivalent mass transit trip
equivalent driving trip
