lets only consider trips under 3 days. that lets us

found coastline: http://support.mapbox.com/discussions/tilemill/293-rendering-osm-processed-coastlines
unfortunately, not enough detail. close...
OSM data: http://download.bbbike.org/osm/bbbike/CambridgeMa/
http://metro.teczno.com/#boston also looks helpful... links to a bunch of empty coastline files though...

elevation from here: http://viewer.nationalmap.gov/viewer/
so... the 1/9 resoltion didn't work... it gave me two files, which didn't seem to cover the metro area.

need gdal

brew install gdal
gdalwarp -s_srs EPSG:4269 -t_srs EPSG:3785 -r bilinear 88128884\\88128884.tif ~/work/hubway-viz/data/elevation/elevation-3785.tif
gdaldem hillshade -co compress=lzw ~/work/hubway-viz/data/elevation/elevation-3785.tif ~/work/hubway-viz/data/elevation/elevation-hillshade-3785.tif
gdaldem slope ~/work/hubway-viz/data/elevation/elevation-3785.tif ~/work/hubway-viz/data/elevation/elevation-slope-3785.tif
gdaldem color-relief -co compress=lzw ~/work/hubway-viz/data/elevation/elevation-slope-3785.tif slope-ramp.txt ~/work/hubway-viz/data/elevation/elevation-slopeshade-3785.tif

to make the elevation data queryable, I've downloaded it in BIL_16INT format. I'll want to reproject it to plate carr√©e so it can be easiily queried in javascript.

Routing:
My idea is to generate a node/edge db from the data, run djikstra's algorithm, and store the routes for all stations. At the very least, storing the distance between each pair of stations.

It would be interesting to factor elevation data into the edges.

After calculating the routes, calculate elevation profiles for them. Using JTS or soemthing, sample the paths to get a set of points, and get the elevations for those points.

MAPC postgres:
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO mapc;

LIDAR
I'm assuming the data in in meters. its NAVD88

Where the fuck is the mystic river polygon in the BBBike shp dataset?
i see in CambridgeMa.shp

need to get rid of parking lots as roads, also maybe some paths, like mt auburn cemetary which are closed to bikes

hourly climate data: http://lwf.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/climatedata.html#hourly -> http://cdo.ncdc.noaa.gov/pls/plclimprod/poemain.accessrouter?datasetabbv=DS3505

Looks like the data is recorded hourly at the 54, and on the hour every 3 hours.
hourly type:
        7: ASOS/AWOS observation merged with DATSAV3 observation
        FM-15: METAR Aviation routine weather report
3 hours:
        4: DATSAV3 observation
        FM-12: SYNOP Report of surface observation form a fixed land station

THIS LOOKS SIMPLER: http://cdo.ncdc.noaa.gov/qclcd/QCLCD?prior=N

It's obnoxious that trips.csv and stations.csv aren't qouted the same. station ids in trips have quotes, not in stations

There are some overlapping trips:
