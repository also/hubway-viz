found coastline: http://support.mapbox.com/discussions/tilemill/293-rendering-osm-processed-coastlines
unfortunately, not enough detail. close...
OSM data: http://download.bbbike.org/osm/bbbike/CambridgeMa/
http://metro.teczno.com/#boston also looks helpful... links to a bunch of empty coastline files though...

elevation from here: http://viewer.nationalmap.gov/viewer/
so... the 1/9 resoltion didn't work... it gave me two files, which didn't seem to cover the metro area.

need gdal

brew install gdal

to make the elevation data queryable, I've downloaded it in BIL_16INT format. I'll want to reproject it to plate carr√©e so it can be easiily queried in javascript.

Routing:
My idea is to generate a node/edge db from the data, run djikstra's algorithm, and store the routes for all stations. At the very least, storing the distance between each pair of stations.

It would be interesting to factor elevation data into the edges.

After calculating the routes, calculate elevation profiles for them. Using JTS or soemthing, sample the paths to get a set of points, and get the elevations for those points.
